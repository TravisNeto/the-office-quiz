# The Office Quiz!
## its a game with 2 categories. True or False and then another category for Character questions
* I choice to do this game because The Office is my favorite show and I thought it would be fun to do a little quiz about it.
* I've used Google for questions and examples, support time with classmates and instructors as my resources
* Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, VS code, live browser.
* Planned future enhancements: I would really like to get the game functioning the way I envisioned it. Both categories with questions, buttons all working. The whole deal.
